# Inverse Scattering for reflection intensity phase microscopy

This is the MATLAB implementation of the reflection intensity phase microscopy reconstruction pipeline from "Inverse scattering for reflection intensity phase microscopy" published in Biomedical Optics Express in 2020. This github provides example code for reconstructing the complex refractive index contrast of an object evaluated in a reflection imaging geometry.

## Abstract

Reflection phase imaging provides label-free, high-resolution characterization of biological samples, typically using interferometric-based techniques. Here, we investigate reflection phase microscopy from intensity-only measurements under diverse illumination. We evaluate the forward and inverse scattering model based on the first Born approximation for imaging scattering objects above a glass slide. Under this design, the measured field combines linear forward-scattering and height-dependent nonlinear back-scattering from the object that complicates object phase recovery. Using only the forward-scattering, we derive a linear inverse scattering model and evaluate this modelâ€™s validity range in simulation and experiment using a standard reflection microscope modified with a programmable light source. Our method provides enhanced contrast of thin, weakly scattering samples that complement transmission techniques. This model provides a promising development for creating simplified intensity-based reflection quantitative phase imaging systems easily adoptable for biological research.

## Implementation Requirements

This code was implemented entirely in python and has been coded and implemented successfully with MATLAB R2018b.
